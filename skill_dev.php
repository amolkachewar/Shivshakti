      <h3>skill development</h3>
      <p> Skilling is a lifelong process. Hence, skill upgradation and reskilling are fundamental components of the skilling cycle. The Shri Shiv Shakti Education Society also sees a close connection between skilling and entrepreneurship. We seek to create synergies between these two areas, so that our youth can aspire to being job seekers and job creators.</p>

      <h3>skill mission</h3>
      <p>The Shri Shiv Shakti Education Society Mission has been developed to create convergence across sectors and States in terms of skill training activities. Further, to achieve the vision of ‘Skilled India’, the SSSES Mission would not only consolidate and coordinate skilling efforts, but also expedite decision making across sectors to achieve skilling at scale with speed and standards. It will be implemented through a streamlined institutional mechanism driven by Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship.</p>
